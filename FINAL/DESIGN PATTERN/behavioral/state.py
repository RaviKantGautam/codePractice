State
Category: Behavioral Design Pattern

================================================================================

DEFINITION
----------
State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior
when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

Each state is represented by a separate class; the context delegates behavior
to the current state object.

WHY IT MATTERS / IMPORTANCE
---------------------------
1. Organizes state-specific code into separate classes.
2. Eliminates bulky state-conditionals (if/elif/switch).
3. Makes state transitions explicit.
4. Related to Strategy, but focused on state transitions.

WHEN TO USE
-----------
- An object behaves differently depending on its current state.
- State-specific code is full of conditionals.
- State transitions are well-defined (FSM-like).

INTERVIEW TIP
-------------
Explain the problem first, then the pattern solution, then walk through the code.
Mention real-world use cases from your projects if possible.

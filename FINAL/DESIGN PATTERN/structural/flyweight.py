Flyweight
Category: Structural Design Pattern

================================================================================

DEFINITION
----------
Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into
the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple
objects instead of keeping all data in each object.

Intrinsic state is shared; extrinsic state is passed in by the client.

WHY IT MATTERS / IMPORTANCE
---------------------------
1. Saves memory when many similar objects exist.
2. Separates intrinsic (shared) vs extrinsic (context) state.
3. Useful for games, text editors, particle systems, caches.
4. Trade-off: more CPU / complexity for less RAM.

WHEN TO USE
-----------
- An application uses a large number of objects that overwhelm RAM.
- Much of object state can be made extrinsic / shared.
- Objects don't need unique identity for most operations.

INTERVIEW TIP
-------------
Explain the problem first, then the pattern solution, then walk through the code.
Mention real-world use cases from your projects if possible.
